            Birds, our chirpy feathered friends, who have amazed us by their aerodynamics and exotic colors, are under
            great threat. There are 9,934 species of birds that are extant in the world today, out of which, a
            staggering 1,313 (13%) are threatened under extinction. As the recent data by the IUCN states, around 197
            species are considered critically endangered, and 389 are listed as endangered. The rest are categorized
            under vulnerable.

        <p><b><i>Non-availability of tiny insects as food due to the loss of vegetation. The excessive use of mosquito repellents Concrete architectures with no nesting sites for sparrows Air-conditioning which leaves ne entry or exit points for feeding sparrow nestlings</i></b></p>
        <p><b><i>Since the 1500s, 130 species of birds have gone extinct, and the number sadly continues to be on the rise. In fact, 4 species of birds are said to be extinct in the wild. However, conservationists are working towards reviving their numbers. The greatest threat to these birds are, well of course, us humans! Deforestation and poaching, along with changing climatic conditions are contributing to the decrease in their numbers</i></b></p>
